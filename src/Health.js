        <h2>Brief</h2>

        Redesign an Apple health app with the goal of boosting daily active users. This involves comprehending the current market, identifying challenges, and suggesting a gamification feature to entice users.

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        According to a 2022 report, 51% of older adults who don't use health apps say it's because of a lack of interest. Other reasons include:
        <ul>
          <li>32% never thought about using health apps</li>
          <li>20% are unsure whether health apps could help them</li>
          <li>14% are uncomfortable with technology</li>  
        </ul>
