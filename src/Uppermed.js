{/* BRIEF */}
      <Text>
        <h2>Brief</h2>

        Over 1,000,000 kidney failure patients are found to be depressed and have trouble sticking to consistent treatment regiments. Kidney failure is a difficult disease for patients to manage. To help patients with their peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatments, the Uppermed app was made. <b>Uppermed tracks treatments via data recording and trend analysis and encourages patients to have a consistent treatment schedule.</b> I was responsible for the UX design of the entire treatment tracking app. This app helped the startup get 600k USD.

{/* PROBLEM */}
      <Text>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>PD patients feel it's time consuming and burdensome to write down their body liquid balance, blood pressure and body weight volume 4 times a day. </li>
          <li>Doctors and nurses feel it's inefficient to only monitor patient's treatment during in-person visits at the clinic due to time constraints and infrequent contact.</li>
       </ul>
      </Text>

{/* HOW MIGHT WE */}
      <HeroText>
        How might we make kidney failure easier to manage for patients
        struggling with the disease every day?
      </HeroText>

{/* GOALS */}
      <Text>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        Create an app that:
        <ul>
          <li>Helps patients manage the recordings of body fluid balance, blood pressure, and body weight.</li>
          <li>Helps clinics monitor patients' treatment progress and streamline communication between patients and doctors during consultations.</li></ul>
      </Text>

{/* PERSONAS */}
      <Text>
        <Anchor id='personas'/><h2>Personas</h2>
        I designed the questionnaire to better understand the backgrounds and pain points of potential users and received 20 (10 patients, 5 doctors, 5 nurses) survey responses and conducted 15 (9 patients, 3 doctors, 3 nurses) user interviews. We created personas for patients and doctors based on our interviews. This approach helped me understand and empathize with my users and design for their needs and goals.

{/* COMPETITOR ANALYSIS */}
      <Text><h2>Competitor analysis</h2>
              I researched some companies with products in the health app space (Omron, Avax, Kardia) to find inspiration. What I took away were:
              <br/><ul>
              <li>Using <b>multiple pages to layer the data with hierarchy</b>.</li>
              <li>Using <b>color for different data categories</b> to help users locate information of interest.</li>
              <li>Display <b>chart with measurement history</b> for tracking the treatment progress.</li>
              <li>Using <b>tabs</b> help <b>navigating</b> through different <b>information</b>.</li>
              </ul>

        <Anchor id='ideation' /><h2>Ideation</h2>
        Every day patients need to measure pressure twice, weight twice, and CAPD four times. Based on previous users' insights, they want a clean interface that only displays important information with options  to navigate other information in order to save their time. With this in mind, I explored 3 different ideas for the dashboard.

{/*ILLUSTRATION*/}
      <Text>
        <h2>Visual inspiration </h2>
        Illustrations used in this project were inspired by humaaans.com. This lively and flexible style really suited Uppermed. We want to promote a relaxing and healthy lifestyle, so we apply blue and green colors with an emphasis on plants. I chose the font <b> Montserrat</b> because it is modern and clean aesthetic. It fits our brand value to create a modern and effective health app. I also like its high <b>readability and scalability. These qualities help make complex and dense data easy to navigate.</b>

        <Anchor id='usability' /><h2>User Testing</h2>
        I developed a click-through prototype on Figma to conduct usability tests to get an in-depth understanding of how users interact with the new interface. I did <b>20</b> tests in total over two weeks with patients between the ages of <b>35 and 65.</b> I created a plan for user testing, including multiple tasks in the prototype and solicited feedback at the conclusion. I received good and surprising reactions to the design while also getting feedback for some areas of improvement which I later implemented into the final design. I really enjoyed talking to users, showing them the new design, and seeing their reactions. It motivates me to make thoughtful design decisions that benefit my users.

      <Text> <b>Feedback</b><br/>
      <b>18/20</b> of patients think the concept is successful and will help make their <b>life easier</b> while doing dialysis treatment.<br/>
      <b>19/20</b> of patients think it's good to <b>quickly see their results</b> on the dashboard .<br/>
      <b>5/5</b> of doctors and nurses provide positive feedback that will help them remind patients to return to the hospital. It <b>reduces labor work  from hospitals.</b> <br/><br/>

      <b>Other insights</b><br/>
      <b>17/20</b> of patients feel it's hard to contact doctors if they have questions to ask.<br/>
      <b>15/20</b> of patients feel it's monotonous to routinely record treatment diaries.<br/>
      <b>18/20</b> of <b>patients live alone</b> and don't contact their family everyday.  </Text>
